# Person Guesser From Image

An intelligent Telegram bot that analyzes images with multiple people and plays an interactive guessing game! The bot uses advanced AI-powered face detection and analysis to identify various facial attributes, then challenges users to a guessing game where it tries to identify which person the user is thinking of through strategic yes/no questions.

### Interactive Guessing Game
- **AI-Powered Questions**: Uses OpenAI API to generate strategic yes/no questions

| `API_KEY` | OpenAI or compatible API key | ✅ Yes | - |
| `API_URL` | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API | ✅ Yes | - |
| `API_MODEL` | AI model to use for chat completions | ✅ Yes | - |
| `MAX_QUESTIONS` | Maximum questions allowed per game | ❌ No | 20 |

## How to Use

### Starting a Game

1. **Start the bot**: Send `/start` command to the bot
2. **Upload an image**: Send an image (JPG or PNG) with at least 2 people
3. **Wait for analysis**: The bot will analyze all faces in the image
4. **Name the people**: Assign names to each detected person (letters only)
5. **Think of a person**: Choose one person from the image mentally
6. **Answer questions**: Respond to AI's yes/no questions with buttons
7. **Verify guess**: Confirm if AI's guess is correct or wrong
8. **See results**: View detailed analysis summary if guess is correct

### Available Commands

- `/start` - Start the bot and see welcome message
- `/cancel` - Cancel the current game session

### Game Flow

```
Upload Image → Image Analysis → Face Naming → Start Game
     ↓
Answer Yes/No/Unsure Questions ↔ AI Asks Strategic Questions
     ↓
AI Makes a Guess → Verify Correct/Wrong
     ↓
Correct: Show Detailed Analysis | Wrong: Continue with Remaining Questions
```

## Core Components

### 1. Image Analysis Engine (`imageAnalyze.js`)

- Uses **@vladmandic/human** library for face/body/hand detection
- Implements advanced color analysis algorithms:
  - K-means clustering for dominant color extraction
  - RGB to HSL conversion for color classification
  - Euclidean distance for nearest color name matching
- Extracts facial features from specific regions (iris, skin, hair)
- Applies polygon-based masking to isolate target areas
- Generates debug visualizations for color analysis

### 2. AI Chat System (`apiChat.js`)

- Initializes guessing game with analyzed face data
- Manages conversation context with OpenAI API
- Implements strict rules for AI question generation:
  - Must ask about observable attributes only
  - Cannot ask about individual names (minimum 3 people for group questions)
  - Must track question numbers and eliminated candidates
- Formats data efficiently to reduce token usage
- Handles JSON-formatted AI responses

### 3. Telegram Bot (`index.js`)

**State Management:**
- `analyzing` - Processing uploaded image
- `naming` - User assigning names to detected faces
- `playing` - Active Q&A game session
- `guessVerify` - Waiting for guess verification

**Modular Handlers:**
- `handleCancelCallback()` - Game cancellation
- `sendGuessMessage()` - Display AI's guess with verification buttons
- `sendNextQuestion()` - Present next question with Yes/No/Unsure buttons
- `handlePlayingState()` - Process user answers and get AI response
- `handleMaxQuestionsReached()` - Force final guess at question limit
- `handleCorrectGuess()` - Display detailed analysis summary
- `handleWrongGuess()` - Handle retry logic or game end
- `handleGuessVerifyState()` - Route to correct/wrong handlers

**Timeout System:**
